        <h2>📜 Why choose IT consultaion</h2>
        <p>
          There are several major benefits to hiring IT consultants. These include the specialized knowledge they bring to bear on a problem and cost savings over employees.

          IT consultants usually have a deep but narrow knowledgebase. They’re experts in their field and have experience implementing and working with the software within it. Chances are that a good consultant will have dealt with a situation very similar to your company’s with another client.

          This gives them real-world experience and firsthand knowledge they can apply to your needs.

          Many companies balk at the high hourly rate consulting companies can charge. This overlooks the significant savings you’ll see from not hiring full-time employees. Consultants are available when you need them, and don’t cost you anything when you don’t.

          Their outsider status also provides a major benefit. It’s easy to get tunnel vision when dealing with a major issue. Providing a new set of eyes is a great way to reinvigorate a project.
